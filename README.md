## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17** or higher
- **Maven**
- **Docker** (optional, for running with Docker Compose)

### Running the Services Locally

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-directory>
    ```

2. Navigate to each microservice directory and build the project using Maven:

    ```bash
    cd basket-service
    mvn clean install
    cd ../catalog-service
    mvn clean install
    cd ../order-service
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. Alternatively, use Docker Compose to run all services together:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

   This will start all the microservices in Docker containers as specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Accessing the Services

- **Basket Service**: `http://localhost:8081`
- **Catalog Service**: `http://localhost:8080`
- **Order Service**: `http://localhost:8082`

### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of the repository allows you to run the services as Docker containers. It will automatically build and start the services when you use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
